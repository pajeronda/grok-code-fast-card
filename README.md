## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Card not showing
- ✅ Check resource is loaded: **Settings** → **Dashboards** → **Resources**
- ✅ Verify file exists at `/config/www/community/grok-code-fast-card/grok-code-fast-card.js`
- ✅ Clear browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
- ✅ Check browser console (F12) for errors

### No response from Grok
- ❌ **Most Common**: xAI Conversation integration not installed
- ✅ Verify integration: **Settings** → **Devices & Services** → look for "xAI Conversation"
- ✅ Check service exists: **Developer Tools** → **Services** → search "grok_code_fast"
- ✅ Check Home Assistant logs for integration errors

### Chat not saving
- ✅ Ensure browser localStorage is enabled
- ✅ Check no browser extensions are blocking storage
- ✅ Private/Incognito mode may block localStorage
- ✅ Check browser console for storage errors

### File attachments not working
- ✅ Check file size (large files may cause issues)
- ✅ Verify file type is supported (images, text, JSON, YAML, etc.)
- ✅ Check browser console for file reading errors
- ✅ Ensure browser supports FileReader API

### Conversation context lost
- ✅ Verify xAI Conversation integration supports conversation memory
- ✅ Check browser console for service call logs
- ✅ Clear localStorage and restart conversation if corrupted

### Formatting issues
- ✅ Ensure Home Assistant 2025.1+
- ✅ Update to latest Home Assistant version
- ✅ Test in different browser (Chrome/Firefox/Safari)
- ✅ Check if browser supports CSS container queries
